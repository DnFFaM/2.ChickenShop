                <p>There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground, but Rachael could see
                    movement. She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher
                    exactly what she had spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be a figment
                    of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree.
                    Then in the corner of her eye, she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring
                    again.</p>
                <p>Don't be scared. The things out there that are unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just
                    unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will
                    be a much less scary place for you.</p>
